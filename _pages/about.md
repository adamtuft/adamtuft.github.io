Welcome to my site!

I'm a PhD student in the [Scientific Computing Group](https://scicomp.webspace.durham.ac.uk/) at Durham University, UK. I'm interested in developing tools for modelling and understanding the performance of task-based parallel programs. My research forms part of the ["Exposing parallelism: Task Parallelism"](https://excalibur.ac.uk/projects/exposing-parallelism-task-parallelism/) project within the UK's ExCALIBUR research programme.

Previously, I completed my M.Sc. in [Scientific Computing and Data Analysis](https://miscada.webspace.durham.ac.uk/) at Durham University. For my thesis project I developed an OMPT plugin for tracing & visualising the structure of OpenMP programs.

Alongside my research, I'm involved in a few other activities:

- I provide teaching demonstration support in my department.
- I am a certified [Carpentries Instructor](https://carpentries.org/).
- I serve as Secretary of Durham's [SIAM-IMA student chapter](https://siam-ima.webspace.durham.ac.uk/).

On my **[blog](blog)**, I share articles/opinions/how-tos that I think somebody might find interesting, but which don't belong in a thesis or paper.

Check out my **[projects](projects)** page where I showcase one or two projects I'm particularly proud of!

In my spare time I love reading, going hiking, and playing boardgames.
