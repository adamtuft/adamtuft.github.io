Welcome to my personal blog!

I'm Adam, a Computer Science PhD student in the Scientific Computing Group at Durham University.

### What's this blog for?

This blog is my repository of all the miscellaneous thoughts, experiences and ideas
that naturally accumulate in the course of a PhD, but which don't belong in a
thesis/paper/poster/talk. I have plans to write about a range of topics, including (in no particular order):

- Personal Projects
- Software Development
- Computer Science
- Programming How-To's
- HPC
- PhD Life

### Who's this blog for?

Myself, mostly - it's mainly somewhere to record any ideas which I think are worth
writing down and don't really belong anywhere else. I also wanted somewhere I could practice writing
and publishing (kind of an important skill for a PhD student) outside of academic writing for a paper
or thesis.

That said, if you're interested in the topics above then I hope this blog will catch your attention!

Thanks for reading, I hope you'll come back soon!

Adam
